# Java and JSP Web Application

This project is a demonstration of session management, cookie handling, and database connectivity features using Java and JSP (JavaServer Pages). The application utilizes MySQL as the database management system and Tomcat Apache server as the web server.

## Features

1. **Session Management:** The application showcases the implementation of session management in a web application. Users can create an account, log in, and perform various actions while maintaining their session state.

2. **Cookie Handling:** The project demonstrates the handling of cookies, allowing users to store and retrieve information on their local machine. Cookies are utilized for tasks such as remembering user preferences or maintaining a persistent login state.

3. **Database Connectivity:** The application integrates with a MySQL database for storing and retrieving data. It showcases how to establish a connection with the database, execute SQL queries, and handle data retrieval and manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The project is developed using Java programming language, providing a robust and scalable backend for the web application.

- **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** JSP is used for generating dynamic web content and incorporating Java code within HTML pages, enabling the development of interactive web pages.

- **MySQL:** The MySQL database is employed for data storage and retrieval. It offers a reliable and efficient solution for managing structured data.

- **Tomcat Apache Server:** Tomcat is used as the web server for hosting and running the Java and JSP web application. It provides a container for executing servlets and JSP pages.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure that JDK is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. **Tomcat Apache Server:** Download and install Tomcat Apache server by visiting their official website. Follow the installation instructions to set up the server.

3. **MySQL Database:** Install MySQL database on your machine. You can download the installer from the official MySQL website and follow the installation instructions.

4. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

5. **Configure Database:** Open the MySQL database management tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench) and create a new database. Modify the database configuration in the project code to match your database credentials.

6. **Build and Deploy:** Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) and build the project. Once the build is successful, deploy the application to the Tomcat Apache server.

7. **Access the Application:** Open a web browser and enter the URL for the deployed application. You should now be able to access the Java and JSP web application and explore the session, cookie, and database connectivity features.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Java web application structure, containing the following directories and files:

- **`src/`:** Contains the Java source code for the web application.
- **`web/`:** Contains the JSP pages, HTML templates, and other web-related resources.
- **`WEB-INF/`:** Contains the configuration files and resources specific to the web application.
- **`pom.xml`:** The project's Maven configuration file, specifying dependencies and build settings.
